# To Do

*June 4, 2022*
I was working on EdX's Calculus 1A: Differentiation. Somehow, I refused to work on a paper; instead, I felt a strong desire to work with Python or bash. What's more, I wanted to spend less time on the internet, since I was feeling like I am not doing internet -- internet is doing me. So, here I am, starting with the help function in python, as well as `info bash` and `info gittutorial`.

Today, I made two repos: "python-visualize-my-math-classes" and "bash-visualize-my-math-classes." After I get some sleep, I gotta continue my Calc class. Find out how best to understand the material. Visualization? I have no idea how I'm gonna do these, but my guess is that it will involve bash and Python, preferably without any external library at first, since trying to do stuff without any external library can be helpful for deeper understanding.

Other stuff I found: [GitHub Documentation on .md files](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
