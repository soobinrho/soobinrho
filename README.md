# Overview

I made too many mistakes of making unrealistic, unspecific goals. 
In my college sophomore year, a shower thought struck my mind: 
I gotta make realistic, specific goals and put these onto my GitHub. 
This page keeps track of all my life goals; plus, I use this page 
also to show every code I wrote with pictures and short descriptions.

## Projects




## Life Goals

Master the method of loci with the help of Joshua Foer's book *Moonwalking with Einstein*; be able to remember whatever I want to remember, such as memories with my best friends or course materials. 

## Goals I am working on currently

**2022 Yearly Goal** Work on my mind palace twenty minutes every day.
Alternatively, use these twenty minutes either to work on my mind palace 
or to plan how I am going to spend my day that day 
-- e.g. no procrastination / no phone (unless necessary) until 5pm, 
catch up on readings 5pm - 7pm.

**April, 2022** Create a GitHub repository for my goals and codes. 
Maybe make some tables so that goals are easy to read.

**May, 2022** Spend three hours every week on edX 
[Calculus 1A: Differentiation](https://www.edx.org/course/calculus-1a-differentiation).

**1st Week of May** Spent only around five minutes on the course. 
(five minutes out of three hours = 2.7%) I had so much free time, but 
I spent almost all of them procrastinating, such as watching YouTube on 
best XLR / USB mics. At least ten hours a day were spent procrastinating. 

**2nd & 3rd Week of May** Spent no time at all on the course. 
It was partly because I had finals, but it was mostly because 
I spent too much time watching YouTubes. 99% my fault. Hopefully, next week will be better.

**4th Week of May** Spent all my time watching Game of Thrones.

**June, 2022** The goal is not to do something perfectly; rather, my goal this month
is to not do specific things which. What do you mean? For instane, I feel like
my phone is doing me -- not the other way around. Technologies can potentially be
extremly beneficial. However, in my case, I cannot stop doing what I do not want to do.
Is it because of the technologies that I had a tendency to spend my time that way?
I do not think so. If there were no technology, I would have spent my time *that* way
with other means. It is not technology's fault, of course.

My goal this month is not something a perfectionist would have.
It actually sounds like a low-bar goal; it could sound easy. However,
my previous experience tell me how hard it actually can be, until my habits are
rewired. I think I heard someone saying that habits become habits after two months.
I should aim to *not do what I do not want to do* for two months -- nothing more, nothing less.

Aiming to do something more will have to come at least two months later.

## Past Goals

**2017** Get full marks on my high-school IB Diploma - Failed miserably.

**2018** Be able to do 72 push-ups so that I can join special forces - Failed. 
I could do only 20.
