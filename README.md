# Overview

I made too many mistakes of making
unrealistic, unspecific goals.
In my college sophomore year, a shower
thought struck my mind:
I gotta make realistic, specific goals
and put these on my GitHub.
This page keeps track of all my life
goals; plus, I use this page
also to show what kind of projects
I'm working on with as many pictures and
and as few words as possible.

## Projects

<!---
#### Coders For Earth [[GitHub](https://github.com/CodersForEarth)] [[Official Website](https://codersforearth.com/)]

An open-source website for
the environment and sustainability.

#### LaTeX Template for College Assignments [[GitHub](https://github.com/soobinrho/latex-college-assignments-template)]

This is a $\LaTeX$ template based on the
`North American GeoGebra Journal Template` and
`Jupyter Lab`'s code-cells preambles.
You can insert `Jupyter Lab` style code blocks,
as well as `GitHub` style inline codes like `this inline code block`.

Personally, I use this for my math assignments, but since its
code blocks look exactly the same as `Jupyter Lab`'s code cells,
it can be used for computer science assignments as well,
if you happen to be the kind of person who likes
to write everyting in $\LaTeX$.

#### College Coursework Programming [[GitHub](https://github.com/soobinrho/college-programming)]

This repository is a collection of all codes I wrote for my college courses,
such as *Computer Science I*, *Computer Science II*, and *Calculus II*.
Most of the graph generation was done by `Python`. Most of the documents were
written with $\LaTeX$.

#### PowerShell Graphs Without Internet Access [[GitHub](https://github.com/soobinrho/powershell-graphs-without-internet-access)]

If you happen to be in an environment where
internet access is prohibited for security
protocol or for any other reason - e.g. military
in some countries - then this repository is for you.

Every Windows computer is likely to have
`PowerShell` preinstalled. This repository was
made for those who need to create graphs but
their workstations have restricted internet
access. View the codes on this repository
on your phone - or you could just print the codes -
and then type them into `PowerShell ISE`, which is a
program that preships with most Windows computers.
These codes will generate graphs that can
be exported to .png or .jpg files.

## Life Goals

Master the method of loci with the help of Joshua Foer's book *Moonwalking with Einstein*; be able to remember whatever I want to remember, such as memories with my best friends or course materials.

## Goals I am working on currently

**2022 Yearly Goal** Work on my mind palace twenty minutes every day.
Alternatively, use these twenty minutes either to work on my mind palace
or to plan how I am going to spend my day that day
-- e.g. no procrastination / no phone (unless necessary) until 5pm,
catch up on readings 5pm - 7pm.

**April, 2022** Create a GitHub repository for my goals and codes.
Maybe make some tables so that goals are easy to read.

**May, 2022** Spend three hours every week on edX
[Calculus 1A: Differentiation](https://www.edx.org/course/calculus-1a-differentiation).

**1st Week of May** Spent only around five minutes on the course.
(five minutes out of three hours = 2.7%) I had so much free time, but
I spent almost all of them procrastinating, such as watching YouTube on
best XLR / USB mics. At least ten hours a day were spent procrastinating.

**2nd & 3rd Week of May** Spent no time at all on the course.
It was partly because I had finals, but it was mostly because
I spent too much time watching YouTubes. 99% my fault. Hopefully, next week will be better.

**4th Week of May** Spent all my time watching Game of Thrones.

**June, 2022** The goal this month is not
about doing something, but rather, it's about
not doing what I do not want to do.
For instane, I feel like my phone is doing
me -- not the other way around.

It sounds easy, but I know how hard it
actually is to stop doing what I have been
doing all my life. I think I've heard someone
saying that habits become habits after
two months. I should aim to
*not do what I do not want to do* for
two months -- nothing more, nothing less:
aimlessly websurfing for instance.

Aiming to do something more than that will
have to come at least two months after.

## Past Goals

**2017** Get full marks on my high-school IB Diploma - Failed miserably.

**2018** Be able to do 72 push-ups so that I can
join special forces for my mandatory
military service - Failed.
I could do only 20.
