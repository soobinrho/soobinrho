# Overview

I made too many mistakes of making
unrealistic, unspecific goals.
In my college sophomore year, a shower
thought struck my mind:
I gotta make realistic, specific goals
and put these on my GitHub.


This page keeps track of all my life
goals. Plus, I use this page
also to show what kind of projects
I'm working on with as many pictures and
and as few words as possible.

# Projects

#### 2023 Google Summer of Code [[FreeBSD](https://wiki.freebsd.org/SummerOfCode2023Projects/IntegrateMfsBSDIntoTheReleaseBuildingTools)]

Integrated mfsBSD into the FreeBSD release tool set.

#### Nsustain [[GitHub](https://github.com/Nsustain)]

🌳 Nsustain is a hobby project. A friend of mine here at my college and I started doing it because we realized it's hard for regular, normal people like us to contribute to environmental sustainability directly.

So, the idea of Nsustain is you can start making direct impact on environmental sustainability. How? By connecting you with people who work in fields related to the environment and by creating computer programs for whatever technical problem they are dealing with hahaha

#### LaTeX Template for College Assignments [[GitHub](https://github.com/soobinrho/latex-college-assignments-template)]

This is a $\LaTeX$ template based on the
`North American GeoGebra Journal Template` and
JupyterLab's code-cells preambles.
You can insert JupyterLab style code blocks,
as well as GitHub style inline codes like `this inline code block`.

Personally, I use this for my math assignments, but since its
code blocks look exactly the same as JupyterLab's code cells,
it can be used for computer science assignments as well,
if you happen to be the kind of person who likes
to write everyting in $\LaTeX$.

#### College Coursework Programming [[GitHub](https://github.com/soobinrho/college-programming)]

This repository contains every code I wrote for my college courses,
including *C++ Programming*, *Computer Science I & II*, and *Calculus II*.
The majority of the graph generation was done using Python,
and the pdf documents were written using $\LaTeX$.

#### Personal Dotfiles [[GitHub](https://github.com/soobinrho/dotfiles-personal)]

This repository is what I use whenever I do a clean install on my computers.
Scripts and configurations for Bash, Zsh, Konsole, Vim, Neovim, etc.

# Goals I'm working on

 - Master the method of loci with
the help of Joshua Foer's book
*Moonwalking with Einstein* so that
I can remember all things I want to remember.
This technique involves creating mental images of
specific locations and associating items to be
remembered with those locations.

 - Work on my mind palace twenty minutes every day.
Alternatively, use these twenty minutes either to work on my mind palace
or to plan how I am going to spend my day that day
-- e.g. no procrastination / no phone (unless necessary) until 5pm,
catch up on readings 5pm - 7pm.

<!---
**August, 2022** Again, same as the
last month. I gotta stop procrastinating.
Spent too much time on YouTube and Reddit.

**September, 2022** I reset the
two-months period for settling in a
new habit. Last month, I
utterly failed to do what I want to do.
This month, I'll try to stop my bad habit
of falling into doing what I don't wanna do.
The thing is, even if there was no Reddit
or YouTube, I would've found something else
to procrastinate with. So, it's not
their problem; it's an internal problem I have.

It'd be nice if I can just close my eyes
or even just fall a sleep, whenever I feel
an urge to open Reddit, watch YouTube, or
whatever. Best case scenario, I'll try to
work on my mind palace whenever I feel the urge.

September 10, 2022
Whenever swimming, I used to have a problem
of not being able to remember how many laps
I did. Today, I realized I can remember more
easily by using my mind palace. It turns out
I have fifteen spots for my school mind palace,
and the number of laps I do also happens to be
thirty. So, I just have to go through my
school mind palace twice to remember my laps.

I noticed I tend to sound more clear when I push my
lower jaw a little bit forward. Yes! I realized
what my dentist told me when I first visited her
-- my teeth are misaligned such that my lower jaw
is a little bit behind, and this may have been
impacting my speech!

HOW DID I ADD BOLD TEXT TO LINKEDIN SUMMARY?
I used unicode bold alphabets.
Example:

What Nsustain does may not be a big help.
It's just a small help, but we're glad
we can contribute to the betterment of
environmental sustainability
in any way we can.
