# Overview

I made too many mistakes of making
unrealistic, unspecific goals.
In my college sophomore year, a shower
thought struck my mind:
I gotta make realistic, specific goals
and put these on my GitHub.

This page keeps track of all my life
goals. Plus, I use this page
also to show what kind of projects
I'm working on with as many pictures and as few words as possible.

## BeeMovr

My friends and I wrote this at 2023 MIT hackathon (HackMIT).
It's a map to help beekeepers and their bees by finding which area has the best potential for honey yield by looking at Open Meteo's environmental data, such as precipitation and temperature.
We host this as a web app on https://BeeMovr.nsustain.com

## Good Life Farms

A self-sustainable platform for local producers, such as farmers and beekeepers, and for local consumers.
Started as a project for Dr. G, my biology professor at my college who has a farm with her husband, but my team realized a lot of local producers would actually want to use this too, so we opened it up for all local producers: https://GoodLifeFarms.nsustain.com

<br>
<br>

## Nsustain

A college friend of mine and I created this because we realized it's hard for regular, normal people like us to contribute to environmental sustainability directly.
So, the idea of Nsustain is that you can start making direct impact on environmental sustainability by asking people who actually work in the field, "what do you all need?" and then writing programs for whatever they need.

| ***Project*** | ***Purpose*** |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| ***BeeMovr***<sup>[1]</sup> | Help beekeepers by coding whatever they need for their bees. |
| ***Good Life Farms***<sup>[2]</sup> | Help local producers (farmers, beekeeprs, florists, and so on) by giving them a platform to serve their shareholders. Deisnged to be as self-sustainable as possible: it's built with Google Sheets and Google Forms instead of fancy, expensive databases. |
| ***Nsustain***<sup>[3]</sup> | Nsustain is a group of volunteer programmers who love the e[N]vironment and [sustain]ability. We write code for whoever needs our code (researchers, farmers, doctors, etc) as long as their work is realted to the environmental sustainability. |

## Google Summer of Code

I integrated mfsBSD into the FreeBSD release tool set, documented at https://wiki.freebsd.org/SoobinRho

Also published at *mfsBSD in Base*. 2024. FreeBSD Journal, Configuration Management, May-June Edition.

## My Goals

- Master the method of loci with
the help of Joshua Foer's book
*Moonwalking with Einstein*.

- Finish all the books I bought.

<!---
**August, 2022** Again, same as the
last month. I gotta stop procrastinating.
Spent too much time on YouTube and Reddit.

**September, 2022** I reset the
two-months period for settling in a
new habit. Last month, I
utterly failed to do what I want to do.
This month, I'll try to stop my bad habit
of falling into doing what I don't wanna do.
The thing is, even if there was no Reddit
or YouTube, I would've found something else
to procrastinate with. So, it's not
their problem; it's an internal problem I have.

It'd be nice if I can just close my eyes
or even just fall a sleep, whenever I feel
an urge to open Reddit, watch YouTube, or
whatever. Best case scenario, I'll try to
work on my mind palace whenever I feel the urge.

September 10, 2022
Whenever swimming, I used to have a problem
of not being able to remember how many laps
I did. Today, I realized I can remember more
easily by using my mind palace. It turns out
I have fifteen spots for my school mind palace,
and the number of laps I do also happens to be
thirty. So, I just have to go through my
school mind palace twice to remember my laps.
