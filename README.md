# Overview

I made too many mistakes of making
unrealistic, unspecific goals.
In my college sophomore year, a shower
thought struck my mind:
I gotta make realistic, specific goals
and put these on my GitHub.


This page keeps track of all my life
goals. Plus, I use this page
also to show what kind of projects
I'm working on with as many pictures and
and as few words as possible.

# Projects

#### Nsustain [[GitHub](https://github.com/Nsustain)]

ðŸŒ³ Connecting people who need our help with people who can help, Nsustain is a forum website where volunteer open-source developers can come help farmers and scientists around the world.

#### LaTeX Template for College Assignments [[GitHub](https://github.com/soobinrho/latex-college-assignments-template)]

This is a $\LaTeX$ template based on the
`North American GeoGebra Journal Template` and
Jupyter Lab's code-cells preambles.
You can insert Jupyter Lab style code blocks,
as well as GitHub style inline codes like `this inline code block`.

Personally, I use this for my math assignments, but since its
code blocks look exactly the same as Jupyter Lab's code cells,
it can be used for computer science assignments as well,
if you happen to be the kind of person who likes
to write everyting in $\LaTeX$.

#### College Coursework Programming [[GitHub](https://github.com/soobinrho/college-programming)]

This repository is a collection of all codes I wrote for my college courses,
such as *Computer Science I & II*, *C++ Programming*, and *Calculus II*.
Most of the graph generation was done using Python. Most of the pdf documents were
written with $\LaTeX$.

#### Personal Dotfiles [[GitHub](https://github.com/soobinrho/dotfiles-personal)]

Whenever I reset my computers, which
are running on KDE Fedora, I use
this repository to re-install everything.
Installing these will give you
the same look as shown below, which
consists of my chosen styles and settings for
Bash, Konsole, Vim, and Neovim.

#### [Work in Progress] PowerShell Graphs Without Internet Access [[GitHub](https://github.com/soobinrho/powershell-graphs-without-internet-access)]

If you happen to be in an environment where
internet access is prohibited for security
protocol or for any other reason - e.g. military
in some countries - then this repository is for you.

Every Windows computer is likely to have
PowerShell preinstalled. This repository was
made for those who need to create graphs but
their workstations have restricted internet
access. View the codes on this repository
on your phone - or you could just print the codes -
and then type them into PowerShell ISE, which is a
program that preships with most Windows computers.
These codes will generate graphs that can
be exported to `.png` or `.jpg` files.

# Goals I'm working on

 - Master the method of loci with
the help of Joshua Foer's book
*Moonwalking with Einstein* so that
I can remember what I want to remember.

 - Work on my mind palace twenty minutes every day.
Alternatively, use these twenty minutes either to work on my mind palace
or to plan how I am going to spend my day that day
-- e.g. no procrastination / no phone (unless necessary) until 5pm,
catch up on readings 5pm - 7pm.

<!---
**August, 2022** Again, same as the
last month. I gotta stop procrastinating.
Spent too much time on YouTube and Reddit.

**September, 2022** I reset the
two-months period for settling in a
new habit. Last month, I
utterly failed to do what I want to do.
This month, I'll try to stop my bad habit
of falling into doing what I don't wanna do.
The thing is, even if there was no Reddit
or YouTube, I would've found something else
to procrastinate with. So, it's not
their problem; it's an internal problem I have.

It'd be nice if I can just close my eyes
or even just fall a sleep, whenever I feel
an urge to open Reddit, watch YouTube, or
whatever. Best case scenario, I'll try to
work on my mind palace whenever I feel the urge.

September 10, 2022
Whenever swimming, I used to have a problem
of not being able to remember how many laps
I did. Today, I realized I can remember more
easily by using my mind palace. It turns out
I have fifteen spots for my school mind palace,
and the number of laps I do also happens to be
thirty. So, I just have to go through my
school mind palace twice to remember my laps.
