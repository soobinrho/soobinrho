# Overview

I made too many mistakes of making unrealistic, unspecific goals. In my college sophomore year, a shower thought struck my mind: I gotta make realistic, specific goals and put these onto my GitHub. This page keeps track of all my life goals; plus, I use this page also to show every code I wrote with pictures and short descriptions.

# Goals I am working on currently

Life Goals - Master the method of loci with the help of Joshua Foer's book *Moonwalking with Einstein*; be able to remember whatever I want to remember, such as memories with my best friends or course materials. 

2022 Yearly Goals - Work on my mind palace twenty minutes every day. Alternatively, use these twenty minutes either to work on my mind palace or to plan how I am going to spend my day that day -- e.g. no procrastination / no phone (unless necessary) until 5pm, catch up on readings 5pm - 7pm.

April, 2022 - Create a GitHub repository for my goals and codes. Maybe make some tables so that goals are easy to read.

May, 2022 - Spend three hours every week on edX "Calculus 1A: Differentiation"
https://www.edx.org/course/calculus-1a-differentiation

1st Week of May - Spent only around five minutes on the course. (five minutes out of three hours = 2.7%) I had so much free time, but I spent almost all of them procrastinating, such as watching YouTube on best XLR / USB mics. At least ten hours a day were spent procrastinating. 

2nd & 3rd Week of May - Spent no time at all on the course. It was partly because I had finals, but it was mostly because I spent too much time watching YouTubes. 99% my fault. Hopefully, next week will be better.


# Past Goals

2017 - Get full marks on my high-school IB Diploma - Failed miserably.

2018 - Be able to do 72 push-ups so that I can join special forces - Failed. I could do only 20.
